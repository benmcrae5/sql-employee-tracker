  ## Installation
  It's using Node.js command line, with a MySQL database. You will need to install MySQL and use the schema.sql and seed.sql files to create the database that this works from (or, you can create your own using the same column and key names...though that seems like a lot of duplicate effort!)
  ## Usage
  Use this repository to get code to update a simple employee tracker...or simply as an example of Node.js interacting with MySQL using mysql2. Either way.
  ## License
  This project is under the license: WTFPL
  ## Contributing
  Please don't - there is no need
  ## Tests
  The schema.sql file will remove then create the database, so if you mess anything up, running schema.sql is a good way to restart (then you can use seed.sql to populate with some simple examples as desired)
  ## Questions?
  If you need to reach me, then you should already know how =)
